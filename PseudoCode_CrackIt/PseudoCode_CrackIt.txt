PseudoCode for Making Digest
    Input:
        1. Read password input
        2. Ask if they want to add salt, pepper.  (y/n)
        3. Ask if they want to do key stretching. (y/n)

    Process
        1. Hash password using a hashing algorithm (e.g. SHA-256, Argon2, etc.)
        2. Do Key stretching if user asked for.
        3. Generate a digest from the hashed password
        
    Output:
        1. Store or transmit the digest for verification

PseudoCode For Recovering Passwords:
    Input:
        1. Read password_Hash
        2. Add Dictionary Files
    Process:
        1. Read dictionary_file into a list of words (dictionary list)
        2. For each word in dictionary:
		    a. Generate a hash using the word
		    b. Compare the generated hash with the password_Hash
            c. If they match, return the word as the cracked password
        3. If no match is found, return "Password not found in dictionary"
    Output:
        1. Cracked password (string) or error message
